</ul>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>4 medium Honeycrisp apples, peeled and cubed (¼-inch)</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon cardamom</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup honey</li>
    <li>½ cup brewed coffee, cooled</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1: Roast the Apples</strong></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss cubed apples with 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 9×13-inch baking dish. Bake for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft and translucent. Stir in grated ginger and set aside to cool slightly.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Cake Batter</strong></p>
<p>Reduce oven temperature to 325°F (160°C). Line a 10-inch springform pan with parchment paper, ensuring some paper comes up the sides. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom. In another bowl, whisk eggs with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until combined. Add brown sugar, cider vinegar, and vanilla; whisk until frothy. In a measuring cup, mix honey and cooled coffee until honey dissolves.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Combine Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>Alternately fold dry ingredients and honey-coffee mixture into the egg mixture in three batches. Fold in cooled roasted apples gently to avoid overmixing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Bake</strong></p>
<p>Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 1 hour 5 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, until top is browned and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool for 1 hour before removing the springform sides.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Chill and Serve</strong></p>
<p>Refrigerate the cake overnight for the flavors to develop. Remove from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour before serving. Pair with non-dairy vanilla ice cream or apple jam for a decadent touch.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips for the Perfect Apple-Honey Cake</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Roasting apples first enhances their natural sweetness and prevents the cake from being too dense.</li>
    <li>Honey acts as a natural sweetener, reducing the need for white sugar and keeping the cake moist.</li>
    <li>Baking the cake a day ahead allows the flavors to meld beautifully.</li>
</ul>
